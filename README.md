CorrectBoxDriftMain.f90 and CorrectBoxDriftmodule.f90 are the main program and module program, respectively, which could be used to eliminate position deviation between the reference lattice system and the simulation systems with periodic boundary conditions for the purpose of correct identification of vacancies, self-interstitial atoms, and their clusters in atomistic simulation when using the defect location methods, such as Wigner-Seitz cell and Lindemann spheres methods.
